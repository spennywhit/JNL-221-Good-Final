      <p>Since the conclusion of the second world war, one element regarding America’s identity has always remained constant. The fact that they are a global military superpower. This was a title that they once shared with the U.S.S.R, but this changed following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Since then, the United States has reigned supreme as the world's sole military superpower. In recent years, however, many have begun speculating whether this remains entirely true. Active U.S Armed Forces troop deployments have started decreasing in some command regions recently, and an increasing majority of the homefront doesn’t particularly like their country’s continuing role as “global policeman”. So what’s the truth behind all of this? Is America starting to decline as the world's sole military superpower?</p>

      <p>One command region where troop deployment seems to be steadily decreasing is the European command. This was once the most important command region for the U.S Armed Forces, but it's clear that they are trying to minimize their presence in this theater. There was a time when all of Western Europe needed America to act as its protector, the Second World War left the European continent devastated. However, after decades of reconstruction, Europe appears to be back on its feet and ready to defend itself. So there’s no need for the U.S to deploy a large number of troops in the European theater.</p>

<p class="caption">America's military presence in Europe has basically diminished in recent years.</p>

      <p>We must also consider the extent of NATO’s recent European expansion when thinking about why the quantity of America’s troop deployment has decreased in recent years. This expansion has included European countries that bring considerable improvements to NATO’s already dominant military presence in the region. This has left NATO’s European flank very strong in recent years, so the Americans are wise to start pulling their troops out of this region while redeploying them in regions with a greater need for their presence.</p>

      <p>Speaking of regions with a greater need for American military presence, this is particularly true for America’s Indo Pacific command. The added U.S troop deployment to this region over the past 5 years alone is staggering, so it's obvious that the U.S is trying to establish a stronger military influence in the region. This should continue to increase too, considering present developments in the region that need to be looked after. The Indo-Pacific region is home to more than 50% of the world’s population and about 40% of the globe's wealth. The Indo-Pacific region is also home to an emerging superpower that’s becoming a bigger threat to the U.S every day, China. Frankly, China is the biggest reason why America is adding military muscle to this region. The country is becoming ever more aggressive with its actions in the South China Sea, as they continue its effort to try and seize control of this international waterway.</p>

<p class="caption">America's Indo-Pacific Command has become the country's most important region.</p>

      <p>China is also boosting its navy at an alarming rate, they currently have the largest navy in the world. All of this is concerning for the Americans, but it's even more concerning for the countries surrounding China. Surrounding nations are becoming victims of China’s aggression more than ever before, concerning issues such as territorial disputes. This has sparked an aggressive response from some of these countries, like the Philippines. The Philippines just elected the son of a formerly brutal dictator and the country is banking on him having a tough agenda regarding China. Beth Vita, a Philippine citizen, is a skeptic of her new president, but she knows that he will be tough in response to China’s growing aggression. However, she doesn’t think her president will do this in cooperation with the U.S. Beth relates to his father's rule and remembers the country having sour relations with the U.S at this time. This makes Vita believe that the U.S will need to send even more troops and military equipment to the region in the future. She’s not wrong, the U.S cannot risk being locked out of the region. As the military superpower of the world, it's America's responsibility to keep tabs on every region of the world. So while the Indo-Pacific region continues through its power struggle, you can count on the Americans to send more troops to the region in a bid to increase its regional presence.</p>

      <p>In the end, it looks like America's military role as a global superpower hasn’t decreased at all. Although troop deployments in Europe have seen a significant decrease in recent years, troop deployments in the Indo Pacific region have seen a similar rate of increase in recent years. So America's military role as a global superpower hasn’t decreased, it's just changed. We are entering an era where important regions of the world are beginning to change, and all America has tried to do in this time is change with the times as well.</p>
